## 1. Core Strategy Overview

With a small monthly budget and no existing social media, the focus should be:

1. **A simple, conversion-focused website** that:
   - Clearly shows all 5 designs.
   - Makes it super easy to buy.
   - Builds trust quickly (policies, photos, “about” story).

2. **One primary organic channel** to start:
   - TikTok **or** Instagram Reels (pick **one** to focus on first).
   - Content style: short, satisfying, aesthetic videos of the cups.

3. **Very small, tightly targeted paid tests**:
   - &#36;30–40/month for **search or social ads**.
   - &#36;10–20/month for **influencer micro-collabs / gifting**.

4. **Email capture**:
   - Even if you barely get traffic at first, start building a list.
   - Offer a small incentive: “Get 10% off your first order”.

## 2. Website / Storefront Plan

### 2.1. Platform Choice

Pick **one**:

- **Shopify** (recommended if you want easiest e-commerce tools):
  - Pros: Smooth checkout, built-in payments, lots of themes, supports growth.
  - Cons: Monthly cost (~&#36;39), but might be worth it if you want scalability.

- **Etsy** (quick & cheap to start):
  - Pros: Built-in audience searching for “Pokemon cup”, easier start.
  - Cons: Less brand control; fees on each sale; can’t fully customize checkout.

- **Simple landing page + Stripe Checkout**:
  - Pros: Very low-cost, simple.
  - Cons: More manual setup, fewer built-in ecommerce features.

**Practical suggestion:** 
If you want fast traction with low tech headache, **start with Etsy + a simple one-page site** that links to the Etsy listing. Later, move to Shopify when you get consistent sales.

---

### 2.2. Essential Pages & Content

No matter what platform you pick, aim for:

#### 2.2.1. Home / Main Product Page

Sections:

1. **Hero section**
   - Large, clean photo of 2–3 cups together.
   - Headline example:
     - “Minimal & Cute Pokémon Cups for Grown-Up Fans”
   - Subtext:
     - “Five designs inspired by Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Gengar & Charmander. Made for everyday use & display.”
   - Clear CTA: **“Shop the Collection”**.

2. **Product grid / collection**
   - Show 5 cards:
     - Pikachu Cup
     - Bulbasaur Cup
     - Squirtle Cup
     - Gengar Cup
     - Charmander Cup
   - Each card: high-quality photo, price (&#36;30–40), “View details” / “Add to cart”.

3. **Product detail (for each design)**
   - Minimal name: “Pikachu Minimal Cup”
   - Price: between &#36;30–40, consistent logic (e.g., all &#36;34 or range based on size).
   - Key bullets:
     - “Minimal, cute design inspired by [Character]”
     - “Dishwasher safe / hand-wash recommended” (whatever is true)
     - “Material: [ceramic/glass/etc.]”
     - “Capacity: X oz”
     - “Made / Printed in [Your Location]”
     - Shipping details (time, carrier, US only).
   - Lifestyle photos:
     - On a desk.
     - With coffee/tea.
     - Next to keyboard, notebooks, etc.
   - Subtle FOMO:
     - “Small-batch production”
     - “Limited quantities per design”

4. **Social proof / trust**
   - At start, you won’t have real reviews. You can:
     - Add “Handmade in small batches by a tiny studio” story.
     - Add clear **return policy**, **shipping policy**, **contact email**.
   - Once you get customer photos: add 2–3 at top.

5. **FAQ section**
   - “Are these officially licensed?” (Answer honestly.)
   - “How long does shipping take?”
   - “Can I put this in the dishwasher/microwave?”
   - “Do you ship outside the US?” (No, at least for now.)

---

### 2.3. Design & Branding

Keep the visual identity aligned with **minimal & cute**:

- Colors:
  - A lot of white/neutral background.
  - One accent color (maybe soft yellow/pastel).
- Typography:
  - Clean sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or system fonts).
- Tone of voice:
  - Calm, playful, slightly nerdy but not loud.
  - Example copy:
    - “Subtle designs, big nostalgia.”

---

### 2.4. Technical Basics

- **Mobile-first**: Most buyers will come from TikTok/Instagram on phones.
- **Fast load time**: Compress images; avoid huge hero videos at first.
- **Analytics**:
  - Install **Google Analytics** or similar.
  - Track: sessions, add-to-carts, purchases.
- **Email capture**:
  - Simple banner or pop-up:
    - “Join the PokéFace list – get 10% off your first cup.”
  - Use: MailerLite, Mailchimp, or Shopify’s built-in email.

---

## 3. Social Media Plan (Starting from Zero)

### 3.1. Choose One Primary Platform

Decide between:

- **TikTok** – better for:
  - Organic reach, discovery, short fun videos.
- **Instagram Reels** – better for:
  - Polished aesthetics, feed + stories + shop integration later.

If you’re unsure, **start with TikTok**, then repost everything to Instagram Reels if you have the bandwidth.

---

### 3.2. Content Strategy (First 4 Weeks)

Goal: **Post 3–5 times per week**.

#### Content ideas:

1. **Aesthetics / ASMR-style**
   - Slow pan over all 5 cups on a clean desk.
   - Pouring coffee/tea into each design.
   - Close-up of details (ears, cheeks, etc.).

2. **Character-focused**
   - One video per design:
     - “Which starter are you?” with Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle.
     - “The Gengar cup for your chaotic side 😈 (but keep it cute).”
     - “Pikachu cup for when you need extra energy ⚡.”

3. **Behind the scenes**
   - Packing orders (even if it’s a mock packing at first).
   - Designing/sketching the characters (if you have that footage).
   - Showing boxes, stickers, etc.

4. **Trending audio + text overlay**
   - Grab a trending sound, overlay text like:
     - “When you love Pokémon but your home decor is minimal.”
     - “POV: you’re a 25-year-old who still loves starters.”

5. **Comparison / POV**
   - “Cups for each starter main 🍃🔥💧”
   - Show 3 cups in order.

---

### 3.3. Profile Setup

For TikTok / Instagram:

- Username:
  - Something like `@pokefacecups` or `@shopPokeface`.
- Bio:
  - “Minimal & cute Pokémon-inspired cups ☕ 
    US only | 5 designs (Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Gengar, Charmander) 
    ↓ Shop now”
- Link:
  - Direct link to your main product/collection page or Etsy shop.

---

## 4. Paid Marketing Plan (&#36;50/Month)

We’ll keep this **very simple** so you don’t burn money.

### 4.1. Split the Budget

Example split:

- &#36;30–40 → **Paid ads** 
- &#36;10–20 → **Micro-influencer / gifting costs** (product + shipping)

---

### 4.2. Option A: Meta (Instagram/Facebook) Ads

Run **one** small campaign:

- Objective: **Traffic** or **Sales (Conversions)** if you set up tracking.
- Audience:
  - Location: United States only.
  - Interests:
    - Pokémon
    - Anime
    - Nintendo
    - “Kawaii” / cute design / minimal home decor
  - Age: 18–35 (start here, adjust later).
- Ad creative:
  - 1–2 image creatives:
    - A clean photo of 3–5 cups together.
  - 1 short video:
    - 5–10 seconds, slow pan, text overlay “Minimal & cute Pokémon cups”.
- Ad copy examples:
  - “Pokémon cups that actually match your apartment ✨ 
     Five minimal & cute designs for everyday coffee. 
     US-only, small batch.”
  - “Pikachu or Gengar? Choose your daily coffee buddy ☕💛 
     Minimal cups for grown-up fans.”

Start with **&#36;1–2/day** and learn:

- After 2 weeks, check:
  - Click-through rate (CTR).
  - Which creative performs best.
  - Any sales that came from ads.

---

### 4.3. Option B: Search Ads (Etsy or Google)

If you use **Etsy**:

- Turn on **Etsy Ads** with a small daily budget (&#36;1–2/day).
- Focus on keywords like:
  - “pokemon mug”
  - “minimal pokemon mug”
  - “pikachu mug”
  - “gengar mug”
- Optimize your titles & tags accordingly.

If you use **your own site + Google Ads**:

- Use **search ads** targeting:
  - “pokemon cup”
  - “pokemon mug minimal”
  - “cute pokemon mug”
- Keep bidding very low and monitor performance.

---

## 5. Influencers / UGC (User-Generated Content)

Even with no social media presence, you can:

1. **Identify 5–10 small creators**:
   - Niche: anime, Pokemon, cozy desk setups, kawaii, study-with-me.
   - Follower count: 1k–10k (micro-influencers).
   - Platform: TikTok or Instagram.

2. **Pitch message (DM or email)**

   Example DM:

   > Hey! I love your content – especially your desk setups. 
   > I run a tiny shop that makes minimal & cute Pokémon cups (Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Gengar & Charmander). 
   > Would you be open to me sending you one for free in exchange for a short video / story of you using it? 
   > No pressure if it’s not your vibe 🙂

3. **What you ask for**
   - 1–2 short videos (unboxing, using the cup).
   - Permission to repost their video on your own account.
   - A story mention + link in bio temporarily (if they’re okay).

This can generate:

- Content you can reuse.
- Some initial traffic and trust.

---

## 6. Pricing & Offer

You’re targeting **&#36;30–40** per cup. To make this feel fair and valuable:

### 6.1. Justify the Price

Make sure product pages communicate:

- Quality: material, finish, weight.
- Small batch / handmade.
- Unique design (minimal & cute, not mass-market).
- Free or flat-rate shipping (if possible).

Example copy:

> Each cup is printed in small batches, with a focus on clean lines and soft colors. 
> Unlike loud, full-color merch, these designs are meant to fit into a minimal, cozy space while still showing your favorite character.

### 6.2. Offer Ideas

- “Buy 2, save 10%”
- “Starter Trio Bundle” (Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle) at a small discount.
- “Free US shipping over &#36;60” (if your margins allow).
